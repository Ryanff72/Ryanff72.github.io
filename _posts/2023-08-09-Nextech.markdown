# NexTech

**Web Development Intern** · June – August 2023

![The Nextech Logo](:nextechthumb.jpg)

My first tech internship, right after finishing high school. This was a learning-focused program run by tech professionals in the Evansville area.

## What I learned

Picked up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on projects. Built a portfolio website from scratch to showcase my game devleopmnet projects.

The program was structured around mentorship from local tech leaders who walked us through what working in the industry actually looks like, from collaboration to project planning.

## Recognition

Won the "Catapult Choice" award for best website in the program, voted on by peers and mentors.
