As a researcher on the HiFi team, I developed an app to facilitate the bioacoustic sound analysis process, and was awarded a paid research assistantship in the fall of 2024. This research is done under Dr. Bellisario, who has many years of experience in biosonic work. The big-picture goal of the project is to track the migration and presence of species across northern Indiana, and to help the Niches Land Trust to find the optimal land to purchase and preserve.\
