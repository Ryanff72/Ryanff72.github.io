- üöÄ **Evaluated Raspberry Pi for Embedded Control** at the National Ignition Facility (NIF), contributing to the functionality of the world‚Äôs largest laser system supporting the US nuclear program.  
- üíª **Ported and Rewrote an Embedded Controller to Linux** using C++, enabling it to function as both an emulator and real controller, improving reliability and testability.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Created GitLab CI/CD Pipelines and JUnit/GTest Harnesses**, enhancing code quality and reliability for critical systems.  
- üêû **Identified and Fixed an ARM-Specific Bug** in the NIF camera controller, resolving a long-standing (over a decade old!) issue with ARM systems to improve system performance.
