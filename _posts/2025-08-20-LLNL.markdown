# Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

**Embedded Software Engineer Intern** · May – August 2025

I spent my summer working on embedded systems for the National Ignition Facility—the world's largest laser system, which supports the US nuclear program.

## What I worked on

**Raspberry Pi evaluation for NIF control systems**  
Assessed whether the Pi could handle real-time control in the National Ignition Facility. It could, and went way above the team's expectations.

**Controller migration from Windows XP Embedded to Linux**  
Rewrote the Programmable Spatial Shaper controller in C++. The new version works as both an emulator and a functional embedded controller, maintaining hardware-accurate behavior in both modes. This is part of an effort to replace a controller that has been running on Windows XP Embedded since the 2000s.

**CI/CD and testing infrastructure**  
Built GitLab pipelines with Docker and set up JUnit/GTest harnesses. Made the codebase more reliable and actually testable.

**Bug hunting**  
Found and fixed a Java bug in the NIF camera controller that only showed up on ARM architecture. The bug had been there for over a decade, unnoticed, because the system previously ran on x86.

## Recognition

Received 'Honorable Mention' at the lab's summer Poster Symposium (roughly top 5 out of all interns).
