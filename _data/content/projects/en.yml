        ### Paragraphs

        #### Paragraph

        **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,

        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        # Background
        ![The Turret Setup](:turret_setup.jpg)
        
        During the summer of 2024 I worked at a very hardware-oriented company, Matrix Design group. Interested by what my co-workers were working on, I decided to try and complete a hardware project of my own.
        # The Process
        
        Coming into the project I had little robotics / electrical engineering experience, but thanks to conversations with one of my co-workers, I was able to learn about breadboarding, relays, duty cycles, and much more.
        Once I got my hands on a plank of wood, a camera, a 3d printer, a raspberry pi, and some wires, servos, and relays, I got to work. I wired up everything, and gave the turret the ability to either be aimed manually or automatically through image-recognition.
        # Results
        ![The Turret Shooting](:turret-shooting.jpg)
        
        In the end, the turret worked well with a few small issues. Due to the (painfully) slow speed of the raspberry pi's processor, it took a long time for the turret to recognize where people were at. Despite the shortcomings, both the manually controlled and computer vision-powered versions were a lot of fun to work with, and I feel that I learned a lot while working on the project!

        ![A screenshot from the site](:microstructure.png)
        
        I created a cryptocurrency trading simulator processing live Coinbase market data to visualize order book depth, bid-ask spreads, and market microstructure!
        The site also allows paper trading with portfolio tracking. Next steps are to maintain user's portfolio value between sessions.
        Here is a [link](https://market-microstructure-visualizer-1.onrender.com/) to the project. Currently hosted with onrender.com, which has a very slow free tier. I would like to get it up and running on my raspberry pi with cloudfare soon.

        ![An Example Wikipedia Post](:wiki_post.jpg)
        
        During the first part of the summer of 2024, I programmed a bot that fetched wikipedia articles and posted them on X.com (Twitter).
        The bot has a number of criteria that have to be met for a randomly generated article to be selected. For example, the article must be available in at least a few different languages, ensuring that it is not too obscure.

        I decided to embark on my game development journey late in 2019, and have since published 11 games.
        I began by teaching myself the basics of Unreal Engine and Blender. During quarantine, I found the time to build my first game, Ichor, a greek-themed arena shooter.

        ![A screenshot from the game Ichor](:ichor_pic.jpg)

        Later in 2020, I decided to switch to Unity for development, as the development cycle was much quicker and it opened the door to collaborate with more people, as Unity is a more popular game engine.
        I was mostly motivated to learn Unity by game jams, which are competitions under which participants have to make a game in a short amount of time - usually only from a few days to a week - under a predetermined theme.
        
        ![A screenshot from the game RunnerOS](:runneros_pic.jpg)

        Over the span of 2020-2023, I participated in many game jams, and developed:
        - Chit Chat, A choose your own aventure interactive fiction game
        - Panda in Space, A rage platformer
        - Cryptologist, A code-breaking pseudo-typing game
        - Idol's Tower, A dungeon crawler with a wacky twist
        - RunnerOS, A desktop-themed platformer, made in 2 days (pictured above)
        - Little Dice, A cute dice puzzle game, made in 2 days (pictured below)
        - Heroes' Emporium, An item mixing puzzle game, also made in 2 days

        ![A gif from the game Little Dice](:little_dice.gif)

        I also worked on a few other projects, some larger and some smaller:
        - Sublime Monkey Perfection, a fast paced platformer (pictured below) which placed #2 overall and #1 in the "IDEA" category in the Finally Finish Something 2022 Jam (although it was not made specifically for that jam)
        - Beat Brawl, a rhythm game I made in an afternoon
        - Meowchemy, a hitman-style stealth game about a cat sneaking around a castle (pictured further below)

        ![The title card for Sublime Monkey Perfection](:smp.gif)

        Overall, I am fairly proud of the game library I have cultivated over the years. Feel free to check the web pages for these games on the [links](https://ryanff72.github.io/tabs/links.html) page of this site.
