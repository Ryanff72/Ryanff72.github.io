        ### Paragraphs

        #### Paragraph

        **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        #### Blockquote

        > **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        # Background
        ![The Turret Setup](:turret_setup.jpg)
        
        During the summer of 2024 I worked at a very hardware-oriented company, Matrix Design group. Interested by what my co-workers were working on, I decided to try and complete a hardware project of my own.
        # The Process
        ![The Wiring of the Turret](:turret-wiring.jpg)
        
        Coming into the project I had very little robotics / electrical engineering experience, but thanks to conversations with one of my co-workers, I was able to learn more about circuitry, relays, duty cycles, and much more.
        Once I got my hands on a plank of wood, a camera, a 3d printer, a raspberry pi, and some wires, servos, and relays, I got to work. I wired up everything, and gave the turret the ability to either be aimed manually or automatically through image-recognition.
        # Results
        ![The Turret Shooting](:turret-shooting.jpg)
        
        In the end, the turret worked well with a few small issues. Due to the (painfully) slow speed of the raspberry pi's processor, it took a long time for the turret to recognize where people were at. There was also a small leak at the bottom of the nozzle. Despite these shortcomings, the manual control version was a lot of fun to work with, and it was quite funny to see which objects the robot recognized as human.

        ![An Example Wikipedia Post](:wiki_post.jpg)
        
        During the first part of the summer of 2024, I programmed a bot that fetched wikipedia articles and posted them on X.com (Twitter).
        The bot has a number of criteria that have to be met for a randomly generated article to be selected. For example, the article must be available in at least a few different languages, ensuring that it is not too obscure.
